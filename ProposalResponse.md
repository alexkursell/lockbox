# Group 16 - Whistle Lockbox

## Tentative Rating
Above Average.

## Comments
 - Good fallback.
 - Will it always listen for audio input?
 - How do you store audio to compare with?
 - Probably start with just magnitude detection, move to frequency detection, and finally to cross-correlation.

## Mark
10 / 10
